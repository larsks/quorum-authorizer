THE SIMPLE VERSION

A requestor runs:

  quorum request <label>

Where <label> matches a configuration section in the quorum
configuration file that identifies:

- What command(s) to run, and
- What user to run the commands as

Running 'quorum request' actually creates a directory
'/var/lib/quorum/<label>'.

Cron runs quorum-authorizer every minute.  If there is a request, the
script:

- Checks for authorization.  An authorization is any file inside of
  the request directory.  There must be N authorizations (where N is
  defined in the config file).

- If the command is authorized, run the command and remove the request
  directory and all contents.

- If the command is not authorized, wall all users.  Rinse, repea.

- If the request directory is more than five minutes old, remove the
  request directory and all contents.

An authorizor runs:

  quorum approve <label>

Which creates a file in the request directory.
